          The ICS4U0 culminating project was to make a game about learning to survive some topic. My project team chose to make our project about surviving math. In Modulo, the player first learns the basic concepts of math, and then applies them in a maze level, and then finally an escape room level. It was my first time creating any sort of project of this scale, and although the project was far from perfect, I am very proud of the game we were able to put together. In creating the game, I learned a lot, both about my teammates as well as the Java language. For instance, I learned that methods could be overridden in an object at the moment it is instantiated, which proved very useful in the project, allowing specific types of Buttons to be created quickly, without needing to build another class. If I go back and change anything about the project, in addition to ironing out some of the kinks that made it into the final release, I would probably add some sort of knowledge-testing aspect to the first level, really making sure the player understands the concepts the game tries to teach them.
